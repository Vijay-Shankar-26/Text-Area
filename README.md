# ✍️ Real-Time Character Counter

This project is a **simple text area with a real-time character counter** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It dynamically tracks the number of characters typed and shows how many are remaining out of a defined limit.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time character count update as you type  
- 🚫 Prevents typing beyond the set character limit  
- ⚠️ Displays a clear warning message when the limit is reached  
- 💡 Simple and responsive design suitable for forms or feedback boxes  

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The text area allows users to type up to **200 characters**.  
2. A **character counter** updates in real time (e.g., `75 / 200 characters`).  
3. When the user reaches 200 characters:  
   - The counter stops increasing.  
   - A red warning message appears: “⚠️ You have reached the character limit!”  
   - The text area border turns red for better visibility.
